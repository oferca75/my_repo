#. Description of the theme
msgid ""
"This theme is fundamentally about words. It's designed using the "
"<strong>best-practices of typography for easier reading</strong>. This is "
"especially important in a world where mobile is an important part of any "
"blog's traffic. Speaking of which, this is designed from a mobile-first "
"perspective. This means it is not only <strong>responsive</strong> but "
"designed to provide maximum readability for mobile users across devices. It "
"even handles images and embedded objects (i.e.: videos) in a mobile-friendly "
"way. It is also built for maximum consistency across different browsers- "
"using Respond.js (to allow older browsers to be responsive) and Normalize."
"css (so it should display consistently across Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox "
"4+, Apple Safari 5+, Opera 12+, and Internet Explorer 8+). All these "
"benefits come thanks to Josh Hopkins's Fluid Baseline Grid, from which this "
"theme receives its name. In addition, the theme includes a couple "
"<strong>SEO enhancements</strong> to cut-down on duplicated content and more "
"clearly declare the intent of a particular page (including Schema.org markup "
"for Blog posts as Articles). <strong>WordPress features it supports:"
"</strong> menus (including a responsive menu for small screens), widgets, "
"custom background image and colors, and featured images per post. You can "
"also optionally add widgets to a sidebar of a post or page for a two-column "
"look (without widgets, they will be displayed as one-column)."
